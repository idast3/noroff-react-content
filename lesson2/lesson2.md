### Bootstrap components

The best thing about React components is that they are reusable. Once written, we can simply import them and use them. We can also import components written by other developers.

You used Bootstrap in an earlier course and we are going to use a library with React versions of the components - [React Bootstrap](https://react-bootstrap.github.io/).

From your terminal/command line, run:

```js
npm install react-bootstrap
```

The first component we want to use from React Bootstrap is the [Navbar](https://react-bootstrap.github.io/components/navbar/).
